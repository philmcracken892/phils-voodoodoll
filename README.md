Voodoo Doll: Mischievous Curse ðŸª†

Welcome to the Voodoo Doll: Mischievous Curse, the RedM script that lets you sprinkle some magical mayhem on your server! Ever wanted to make your pals lean back like theyâ€™re daydreaming, cough like they inhaled a dust storm, orâ€”yepâ€”puke their guts out? This is your ticket to cackling like a swamp witch while your friends wonder why their cowboyâ€™s having a really bad day.

Whatâ€™s This All About?

This script adds a voodoodoll item to your RedM server (powered by RSG-Core and ox_lib). Use it to:





Pick a nearby player from a snazzy menu.



Choose a curse: make â€˜puke, drink a brew, or sleep.



Watch them squirm for 5 seconds while you channel your inner voodoo priest with a praying animation (press E to stop or wait 30 seconds).



Sit back and enjoy the chaos, with a 60-second cooldown to keep things fair.

Itâ€™s perfect for roleplay shenanigansâ€”just donâ€™t be surprised if your victims start chucking tomatoes!

Features Thatâ€™ll Tickle Your Funny Bone





Target Selection Menu: Pick your victim like youâ€™re choosing a fine wine (within 10 meters, no binoculars needed).



Curse Menu: Choose your flavor of mischiefâ€”disorient, cough, or hurlâ€”with a click.



Mystical Vibes: Youâ€™ll pray like a voodoo guru while your target flops around.



No Mess Left Behind: Animations clean up automatically, even if the server takes a nap.



Fair Play: A 60-second cooldown stops you from turning the saloon into a puking contest.
